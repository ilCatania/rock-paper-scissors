How to play
===========

The first player that reaches the score treshold wins the game.
Each hand, players must choose a hand sign before the countdown
expires. The signs are then matched against each other, and for
each winning combination against another player's sign (e.g. 
'Rock crushes Scissors'), you get one point.

Remember to pick a sign before the countdown timer runs out!
